# About the project

This my first update for this course. I'm really excited about this course because "open data" fascinates me. I have some experience with R and GitHub so I hope that I won't have some much problem with those.

## Personal goals for this course

* Learn to be better with R
* Learn more about data analysis
* Learn to use English when "doing statistics"
